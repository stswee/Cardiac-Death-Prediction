However, the patient's current medications, including Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker, Beta Blockers, Loop Diuretics, Spironolactone, and Statins, are appropriate for managing heart failure and reducing the risk of further cardiac events. The patient's LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction) is 30%, which is low but not extremely low. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, and the absence of ventricular tachycardia or sustained ventricular tachycardia on the ECG is a positive sign. The patient's NT-proBNP level is elevated at 4250.0 ng/L, which is consistent with heart failure, but the level is not extremely high.
